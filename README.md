Creating a tidy dataset from data of _Samsung Galaxy S smartphone accelerometers_
========================================================
* The data was downloaded from: (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), and extracted into the working directory (yielding "./UCI HAR Dataset/", as data directory).  
* **The analysis script "run_analysis.R" needs to be located in the working directory,
i.e. above the "./UCI HAR Dataset" - folder.** 
* The processing steps within the ./run_analysis.R" script can be found in the
 "./CodeBook.md" 
* The tidy data set is contained within "./tidy_data.txt"
